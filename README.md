# Count-Stomata

Step by step guide to count stomata for biologists using Linux. Every file is given separately to cross check the results side by side before proceeding to the next step.

The below codes are tested on Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS using bash, Python2.7 or ImageMagick.

Install conda as instructed by https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html. 

Install ImageMagick as instructed by https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/imagemagick. By default, it will install all the dependencies along with the relavant libraries.

Here, *png* format is used, since the image captured by microscope must be edited/measured using Microsoft paint 2D.
